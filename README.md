# Uncryptor
This is a project for Netanya Academic College B.Sc. by Orr Shachaff, Jonathan Suzy and Or Nevo Michrowski.

The Uncryptor fights ransomware by collecting encryption keys at runtime from all programs, and storing them in his servers.
Once a client got infected with ransomeware, the keys for decrypting the files will be stored safetly in the Uncryptor's servers,
available for recovery.

Made with :heart:
